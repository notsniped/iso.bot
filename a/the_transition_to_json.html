                <p>The first time isobot went live to many servers, the entire economy had to store data on a database so that even after a bot restart, the data would be safely stored.</p>
                <p>The first thing I looked at when thinking about data storage for the bot was something called pickle, used by <code>import pickle</code>. This database had many advantages like a small initilazation code, compact file size, and extreme utility. But while using this I kinda overlooked on the disadvantages of this system, some of them being:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Binary-only storage</li>
                    <li>(Sometimes) unstable data saving</li>
                    <li>Non-rescuable data, unless you use specific custom-coded functions</li>
                    <li>Data-save fails</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>I don't think I have to explain about any of these problems, as they are probably self-explainatory. But they are some issues that make me want to not use the system. Another big issue with using pickle is that if I want to make new records, like adding a new item to the shop, the old database won't work with it. Instead I have to delete the old database with all the data. Then all of the member's data will get removed, which is a big inconvenience for some people.</p>
                <p>Therefore, I have started to use JSON, which can combine multiple databases into one large database, for convenient storage. Plus all the data is human-friendly and readable by every normal person. Plus to add new records to the bot's storage, the old data can be stored safely with no problem.</p>
                <p><b>From <u>20-12-2021</u>, the transition from pickle binaries to JSON will commence, and the transition will finally finish by the <u>end of January 2022</u>. Cannot wait for the transition to be complete! Looking forward to it.</b></p>
